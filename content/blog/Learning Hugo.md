I figured I'd document learning how to use Hugo, since I "needed" a website to have something to point
people to whenever someone for whatever reason would want to look up my profile. I originally started with Jekyll,
because I didn't know any better, and just selected the default option on GitHub. However, the theme I had chosen
didn't look the best, and I didn't exactly know how to actually touch the theme, since it was just set using the config file.
I'm sure there was a better way to have gone about it, but at that point, I thought I'd just jump ship onto Hugo after hearing
other people's positive experiences with it.
