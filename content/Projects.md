Currently, the only public project I have is my dotfiles repo, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Rowaaaaan/period).

# Contributions
+ I tried to package Arduino IDE 2.0 for Void once. Once. It didn't work out.
+ [hello-world.rs](https://github.com/mTvare6/hello-world.rs) - A blazing fast minimal implementation of "Hello World", written in Rust.
