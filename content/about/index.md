Hello, I'm known online as Rowan!

I am a Computer Science graduate, specializing in embedded IoT development with microcontrollers. Been programming for around four years, mostly having experience with C and C++, as well as Python. I also have backend development experience with Java using the Springboot Framework. Currently, I'm learning fullstack web3 development with the Solana blockchain using Rust and Typescript.

I like building things for the sake of building them, regardless of its practical value–assuming it actually works. I’m always open to learning, and am willing to try anything and everything.
