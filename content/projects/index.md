# Projects
- [Tic Dapp Toe](https://github.com/Rowaaaaan/tic-dapp-toe) - An attempt at implementing tic tac toe using two different wallets that interact
with each other on the Solana Blockchain. Made with the Anchor Framework in Rust, and Vue.js/Typescript.
- [My Linux dotfiles](https://github.com/Rowaaaaan/period).

# Contributions
+ [Solana-web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) - Minor documentation for the legacy transaction API.
+ [hello-world.rs](https://github.com/mTvare6/hello-world.rs) - A blazing fast minimal implementation of "Hello World", written in Rust.
+ I tried to package Arduino IDE 2.0 for Void once. Once. It didn't work out.
